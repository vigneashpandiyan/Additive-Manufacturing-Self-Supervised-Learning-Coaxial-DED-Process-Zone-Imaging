# Overview


Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising solution for real-time monitoring of the quality of
additively manufactured (AM) metallic parts. This study focuses on the Laser-based Directed Energy Deposition (LDED)
process and utilizes embedded vision systems to capture critical melt pool characteristics for continuous
monitoring. Two self-learning frameworks based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Transformer architecture
are applied to process zone images from different DED process regimes, enabling in-situ monitoring without ground
truth information. The evaluation is based on a dataset of process zone images obtained during the deposition of
titanium powder (Cp-Ti, grade 1), forming a cube geometry using four laser regimes. By training and evaluating the
Deep Learning (DL) algorithms using a co-axially mounted CCD camera within the process zone, the down-sampled
representations of process zone images are effectively used with conventional classifiers for L-DED process
monitoring. The high classification accuracies achieved validate the feasibility and efficacy of self-learning strategies
in real-time quality assessment of AM. This study highlights the potential of AI-based monitoring systems and selflearning
algorithms in quantifying the quality of AM metallic parts during fabrication. The integration of embedded
vision systems and self-learning algorithms presents a novel contribution, particularly in the context of the L-DED
process. The findings open avenues for further research and development in AM process monitoring, emphasizing the
importance of self-supervised in-situ monitoring techniques in ensuring part quality during fabrication.
